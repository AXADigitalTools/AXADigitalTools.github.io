    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Can I use my own preferred repairer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, but to ensure your repairs are carried out to the vehicle manufacturer's specifications and guaranteed, for your own convenience we would recommend you use one of our approved repairers. However, if you choose to use your own repairer, you wouldn't get a courtesy car from us, and any car provided by your repairer would have to be insured by you. We also won't be able to help you with any problems you might have with the repairs.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Can I choose when I have my car repaired?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, but if your vehicle is immobile or unroadworthy, our approved repairer will collect your vehicle within 24 hours, subject to availability, and supply a courtesy vehicle.</p>
    </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Will I be provided with a courtesy vehicle?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, if your car is repaired by one of our approved repairers, you'll be given a small courtesy car. If you have taken out our courtesy car upgrade, we'll ensure the car you get is a similar size to your own.</p>
    </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Will the repair be guaranteed?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, we provide a lifetime guarantee when you use our approved repairers, for as long as you own the vehicle.</p>
    </div>
    </div>


    <div class="accordion-wrapper">
    <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>Will the repair invalidate my manufacturer's warranty?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>No, as we insist that our approved network repairs vehicles in line with manufacturer and Thatcham Research Centre guidelines.</p>
